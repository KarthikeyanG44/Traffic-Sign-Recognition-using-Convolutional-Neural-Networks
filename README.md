# Traffic-Sign-Recognition-using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
This repository contains the codes, data and other relevant material for the course project of ECE 6258 Fall 2019, Georgia Tech. In particular, we explore the use of special CNN architectures with Spatial Transformer Networks for robust networks that are invariant to geometric translations in the image.
